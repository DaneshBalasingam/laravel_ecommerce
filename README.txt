Welcome to laravel ecommerce

This is a work in progress!!!!!! It is for educational purposes only.  

Running database migration will install a default admin user
name : testUser
email: test@yahoo.com
password: password

Current version has working products, article, pictures, category based menu, gallery, cart, tag search functionality. Validation and middleware to control access to admin pages is also functional.

Look out for future versions to include image editing capabilities and tiny mce for article sections.
