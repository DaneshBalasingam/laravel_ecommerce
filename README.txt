Welcome to laravel ecommerce

This is for educational purposes only.  

This is a study in using laravel 5.0 to create an ecommerce application. Currrent version has CRUD functionality for users, articles, products, images. gallery, cart, tag search functionality. Admin and customer roles are also complete. CSRF, SQL injection prevention and password encryption security have been addressed. It is also a study in secure AJAX file upload particularly with regards to image and gallery creation. This creates a image to article product experience similar to wordpress. There is fairly involved logic with this regard. The cart functionality is also uses secure AJAX. All form validations are complete. Middleware is used to control access to admin pages. The application is responsive.

Running database migration will install a default admin user
name : testUser
email: test@yahoo.com
password: password

Current version has working products, article, pictures, category based menu, gallery, cart, tag search functionality. Validation and middleware to control access to admin pages is also functional.

Look out for future versions to include image editing capabilities and tiny mce for article sections.
